# Proposals

Proposals are used to make official decisions within the Volatility Protocol DAO. Creating a proposal is an iterative process that goes from Idea -> Proposal -> Community Call & Final Merge -> Voting -> Approved / Failed. This is a transparent and open process that gives clear information to all community members and allows for all community members to give input.

# From Idea to Implementation

In order for a proposal to be successfully implemented it needs to move through the following steps.

Proposals that fail any of these steps are considered Failed.

## Step 1 - Idea

Anyone can publicly post an idea that they have for a proposal on the [Volatilty Protocol Forum](forum.volatilty.com). This could be changes to rewards, a volatility methodology, or etc. The purpose of an idea is to elicit lots of feedback. Therefore, itâ€™s good practice to do the following:

1. Tag your post with [IDEA]. Both in the title and with the tag.
2. Give your post the appropriate categories (e.g. Governance DAO or Governance PIP).
3. Describe your idea in the text of the post.
4. Ask questions that you need to turn your idea into a draft proposal. 

There is no time requirement for how long an idea must be posted in the forum before adding it as a proposal but it is best practice to get feedback on your idea.

## Step 2 - Proposal

Clone this repository and fill out the [Proposal-Template](https://github.com/Volatility-DAO/DAO-Proposals/blob/main/Proposal-Template.md).

A proposal goes through the following life cycle: Draft -> Final Comments.

Proposals that do not complete this cycle are considered Dropped. 

#### Draft

This is the first iteration of a proposal. Typically a Draft will undergo a series of rapid changes. Authors of the proposal should notify the community that the Draft is up and try to build consensus to move the Draft to Final Comments. Community members can open issues to flag sections that are unclear or sections with which they disagree. If the disagreement is around the parameterization of a part of the proposal (e.g. the number of rewards), [SnapShot](vote.volatility.com) can be used as a polling tool to allow community members to signal their preference. There is no set time period for a proposal to be in Draft form but a majority of complaints should be resolved so that the proposal does not become Failed.

#### Final Comments

When an author feels that most major issues have been resolved and there is consensus around their proposal they can move it to Final Comments. An announcement in the Community Discord will be made that a proposal is in Final Comments. If no other major concerns arise in a 48 hour time period, the proposal will be slated for discussion in a community call. 

#### Dropped

These are proposals that do not make it to the Community Call & Final Merge (e.g. they are abandoned).

## Step 3 - Community Call & Final Merge

Community Calls for the DAO currently happen weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays at 16:00 UTC in the community Discord. After a proposal has reached Final Comments it will be slated for discussion in a community call. The author of the proposal will address questions and comments from the community. Any final comments are merged into the proposal.

## Step 4 - Voting

Text from the final merge can be put on SnapShot for voting by token holders. Any VOL token holder with 1,000 tokens can initiate the Final Merge as a proposal on SnapShot. SnapShot proposals must be live for at least 72 hours and must be publicised in the Discord announcements channel.

## Step 5 - Approved

A proposal in which tokenholders vote for the proposal to pass is considered Approved.

## Step 5 - Failed

A proposal that either does not pass a vote or that does not meet the criteria and steps for proposals is considered Failed. For example, if a SnapShot vote approves a proposal but that proposal was not discussed on a community call or if the voting time period was less than 72 hours, that proposal would be considered Failed.
