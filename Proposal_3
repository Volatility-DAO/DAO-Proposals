| Simple Summary | This proposal will return the decision of rewards allocations to the voters and will also revert the DAO Allocation back to rewards.|

## Abstract
Proposal 3 is a new proposal based on the draft proposal on rewards submitted by #newnamesamegai and the comments on it in the github.  The original draft proposal has been up for comment since August 29, 2021.

## Motivation
The passing of Proposal 1 had multiple effects on rewards.  Firstly, weekly voting was removed, along with the reward categories of Uniswap LP (was receiving ~0%), rewards on rewards and governance (these categories caused considerable work on the VOL team). Secondly, reward allocations were set at 50% SLP, 25% Staked VOL, and 25% DAO allocation.  While the proposal passed easily, there were concerns voiced fairly soon after the vote. Some of these were:

1. There was not enough time to comment on the proposal.
2. The DAO already has a treasury, does it need more?
3. Many people enjoyed voting to influence the rewards.
4. The % for SLP should be higher, due to the risks of providing liquidity.

Proposal 3 will address these concerns, along with the concerns that created the initial proposal that passed.

## Specification or Details
Proposal 3 may consist of 6 separate votes, Part A - Part F.
Part C - Part D will only be voted on if Part B passes.
Part E - Part F will only be voted on if Part D passes.

**Part A: Should we return DAO Allocation to Community Rewards?** YES or NO
A YES vote on Part A will return the 25% of weekly rewards currently allocated to the DAO back to Community Rewards. A NO vote on Part A will leave the 25% of weekly rewards going toward the DAO.

**Part B: Should we return to regular reward voting to set the reward allocations for SLP and Staked VOL?** YES or NO

*Only if Part B passes:*
**Part C: What frequency should the rewards vote be?**
Weekly | Bi-Weekly | Monthly | Other

**Part D: Should we allocate a minimum to each SLP and Staked VOL, with the remainder being decided by vote?** YES or NO

*Only if Part D passes:*
**Part E: What percentage minimum should be allocated to SLP?**
5% | 10% | 15% | 25% | other

**Part F: What percentage minimum should be allocated to Staked VOL?**
5% | 10% | 15% | 25% | other

Parts E and F will set minimum allocations based on the % with the most votes.  If "other" wins, we will revote with more choices after taking community feedback.
