| Simple Summary | Propose changes to the VOL rewards |

## Abstract
This proposes to revert back to quadradic voting for rewards.

## Motivation
The original proposal process that changed rewards did not allow for adequate feedback.

## Specification or Details
The people that proposed it did not communicate with the team and ask for dao funds. As such they allocated rewards to be paid to the dao fund.
The LP rewards have taken a massive cut after the vote.
This proposal is to have the community decide and lock reward payouts based on a quadratic voting system, as we were using before. This reward scheme would be put in place, for a minimum number of days to be voted on below (21-days, 30 days, 40 days), or until a specific yes/no vote is held to decide to change it. If the required amount of days have passed since the vote or a yes vote to change has been confirmed, a new vote may be held to readjust reward allocations.

The categories are as follows:

• Sushi LP Shares for VOL/ETH Pool — VOL rewards will be distributed proportionally to Sushi Swap liquidity providers. To add liquidity, visit the Sushi LP pool at https://app.sushi.com/add/ETH/0x5166E09628b696285E3A151e84FB977736a83575

(Note that the SLP tokens created using proceeds from the IDO and held by Volatility Protocol will not be staked.)

• Staked VOL Tokens — VOL rewards will be distributed proportionally based on the amount of VOL tokens staked.

• Governance Participation — VOL rewards will be distributed proportionally based on the amount of VOL tokens used in voting. (Note that while this vote is technically outside of the rewards week, it counts towards next week’s rewards.)
