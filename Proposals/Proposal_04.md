## Abstract & Motivation

Quadratic Voting is no longer aggregating the preferences of the community when there are few votes on rewards. In the November 9th vote, many more tokens voted for Staked LP but a few more accounts voted for Sushi LP. Because the total of accounts voting was only 34 even having a few less accounts vote heavily weighted the preference against Staked LP.

## Specification or Details

This outlines a series of two votes. Vote B will only count if Vote A passes. 




### Vote A - Changing Voting Mechanic For Rewards

This vote is to change the voting mechanic for future votes on community rewards. Specifically, it determines whether quadratic voting will remain to be used for community reward votes.

A **YES** vote means that the mechanic will be changed. This mechanic will be determined by Vote B.

A **NO** vote means that the mechanic will not change. Quadratic voting will remain the mechanic.





### Vote B - Changing Voting Mechanic For Rewards

This vote will only count if Vote A passes. This vote is to determine the new mechanic for voting on community rewards. This is a single choice vote. The choices are as follows.

**Single Choice** - Each voter may select a single choice to give their total voting power to.

**Weighted Voting** - Each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices.
