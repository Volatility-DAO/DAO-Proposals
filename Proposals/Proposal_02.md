| Simple Summary | The Volatility Protocol community currently is without an operating plan, organization, and governance rules for a DAO. This proposal enables a team to develop and propose foundational infrastructure for the DAO which will in turn enable new products, community building, marketing, and many other activities. This proposal does NOT create a permanent executive team or permanent working groups. It is a SHORT-TERM, intensive research collaboration with the end goal of putting forward PROPOSALS.|

## Abstract
The Volatility Protocol white paper references the need for a community in order to realize a true, decentralized, and open-source volatility protocol. With the public release of the VOL token, the community is now able to fund creation of a distributed autonomous organization that will drive the ongoing development and adoption of Volatility Protocol’s products and services. While a small community of VOL holders and enthusiasts has sprung up on Discord, the need for more thorough governance and community development is necessary to the success of the Volatility Protocol.

## Motivation
Similar to the success of the S&P Dow Jones VIX index in equity markets, the need for comparable indices in hyper-volatile cryptocurrency markets is clear. Utilizing the unique capabilities of on-chain decentralization and open source software, Volatility Protocol has an opportunity to fuel new decentralized indices and other DeFi products currently unavailable. The Volatility Protocol whitepaper calls for a truly decentralized DAO which when paired with industry best practices can provide our community with a highly impactful and profitable vehicle for developing and promoting the protocol.

## Specification

1. DAO Governance. Research and document DAO governance best practices and submit a detailed proposal recommending a governance plan for Volatility DAO by September 30, 2021 for comment with voting no later than October 7, 2021. Plan will cover:

* Analysis of other DAO’s used as benchmarks
* Proposed governance organization structure
* Proposal process
* Proposed voting methodology
* Contributor and working group lead compensation, including compensation for ad hoc contributions
* Systems required or enhancements to existing systems (e.g. use of POAPs within existing systems)
* Preliminary DAO mission & objectives
* Funding requirements

2. Working Groups. Develop interim working group plans for Product, Marketing & Community working groups. Submit proposal for each including 90 day “startup” plan by September 30, 2021 for comment and voting no later than October 7, 2021. Each plan will cover:

* Proposed working group mission
* 90-day objectives
* Team/talent requirements
* Proposed interim leadership
* Systems required
* Proposed funding requirements
* Founding Council Members

In addition @Theta , @DarkKnight & @ ccashwell are invited to participate in this process as well.

### Budget

In the interests of ensuring a successful launch of the DAO and maximizing participation in this important process, a budget of no more than 142,00 VOL will be deployed against this effort.

71,000 VOL will be allocated to participating members in the founding council and distributed on a pro-rata basis according to contribution effort. Founding council members will summarize their activities after four weeks in a Google Sheet and share with the founding council which will collectively agree how to distribute the budgeted VOL tokens. As a general guideline, those working on the council full-time (30+ hours per week) will be given greater (~2x) consideration than those contributing on a part-time (~10-20 hours) basis.

An additional allocation of up to 71,000 VOL is requested for potential community or other third-party contributions in support of the founding council’s objectives. Approval for spending this allocation is subject to a majority of founding council members approving the amount with a “I agree” vote on the founding council discord channel.

All VOL rewards will vest 100% after 180 days.
