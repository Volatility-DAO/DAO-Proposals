| Simple Summary | |

## Abstract
The purpose of this proposal is to drive awareness of Volatility to attract broader interest in the volatility project which will broaden and grow the volatility dao community.

## Motivation
There is a need for broader market awareness of the volatility protocol as the Volatility Oracle is coming to market soon. Currently the marketing efforts by Volatility Group have been limited and have emphasized the importance of the Volatility Dao community building an outward facing voice for the project

## Specification and Details

This proposal provides rewards to Dao community participants for making meaningful contributions that drive awareness of Volatility protocol, community engagement and helps further Volatility protocol adoption.
Our goal is to incentify broad participation and encourage implementing new ideas during these activities and not limit the contributions to a small group of people. At the same time we have to be realistic that people will be at the core of these activities and rewards distribution and this will also act as an experiment on how we can build decentralized participation and rewards distribution that is fair. We do believe that this will help attract new engagement and participants in the project while helping incentify those that make meaningful contributions.
There are 5 focused areas we believe will make a significant impact for the Volatility projects growth and increased engagement:


Social Media
Creation of a Twitter account with 3-5 weekly community lead twitter posts per week including projects updates, community activities and “hot meme pancakes” to keep it fun.

Content Creation
Publish a weekly Volatility Dao community update using Medium that includes key project metrics, updates on community progress and is designed to keep the community engaged on a frequent basis. Other community lead content ideas are encouraged. Example: https://medium.com/volatility-dao/volatility-dao-weekly-update-oct-3rd-10th-2021-4fd9f392d73b


Community Outreach
Engage with community partners on social media on a bi-weekly basis such as UMA, Poapathon and other crypto projects to expand the community.
Discord + Forum + Notion Optimization / Engagement
Optimize volatility discord / notion tools for community engagement. Optimizing onboarding / engagement.

Creative Design 
The creation of Volatility DAO community branding, Marketing materials, POAPs for use on weekly community calls, Hot Meme Pancakes and more to keep the community fresh and fun.

Rewards will be paid for participation in the outlined activities on a bi-weekly basis. Rewards will be allocated based on concensys by community participants either manually, using Coordinape or a similar tool to agree on project contributions and distribution of rewards. Part of this project involves figuring out ways we can effectively accomplish this as a community.

In order to be eligible for rewards you must be an active community member on discord for >1 week that regularly participates and contributes to the VOL DAO and has participated in a community call. This will be confirmed by Discord activity. Alternatively an existing member can also approve participation by community if there is an existing relationship.

Rewards will be paid using KPI options outlined as VOLunTier1 on a bi-weekly basis which will require allocation of VOL from the DAO treasury. The community will be able to choose the VOL allocation as a part of this vote from weekly increments of 5 VOLunTier1 (500 VOL), 15 VOLunTier1 (1,500 VOL), 25  VOLunTier1 (2,500 VOL). If we use 10 weeks this would be a range from 5,000-25,000 VOL depending on which amount the community chooses. 
If the proposal passes, it would start immediately following the vote and would remain active through 12/31/2021 which we can then decide on continuing the rewards, adjusting or cancelling the campaign efforts.

This proposal will consist of 2 parts. Part B will only count if Part A passes.

Part A: Should the community set aside an allocation of KPI options every 2 weeks for for meaningful contributions?  
YES or NO

Part B: How many VOLunTier1 KPI options should be allocated weekly for community contributions?
5 VOLunTier1 (500 VOL) | 15 VOLunTier1 (1,500 VOL) | 25 VOLunTier1 (2,500 VOL)

The KPI options for Part B will come from the team OR be minted using the DAO treasury. They WILL NOT come out of future rewards.
